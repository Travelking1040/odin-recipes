        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ui>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>400g/14oz beef mince</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
            <li>100g/3½oz carrot, grated</li>
            <li>2 x 400g tins chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>400ml/14fl oz stock (made from stock cube. Ideally beef, but any will do)</li>
            <li>400g/14oz dried spaghetti</li>
            <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        </ui>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and once hot add the beef mince and a pinch of salt and pepper.<br> Cook the mince until well browned over a medium-high heat (be careful not to burn the mince. It just needs to be a dark brown colour).<br> Once browned, transfer the mince to a bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add another tablespoon of oil to the saucepan you browned the mince in and turn the heat to medium. Add the onions and a pinch of salt <br>and fry gently for 5-6 minutes, or until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the grated carrot then<br> pour the mince and any juices in the bowl back into the saucepan.</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes to the pan and stir well to mix. Pour in the stock, bring to a simmer and then reduce the temperature to simmer gently <br>for 45 minutes, or until the sauce is thick and rich. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook the spaghetti, heat a large saucepan of water and add a pinch of salt. Cook according to the packet instructions. Once<br> the spaghetti is cooked through, drain and add to the pan with the bolognese sauce. Mix well and serve.</li>
