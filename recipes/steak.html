        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ui>
            <li>2 fillet steaks (about 200g each), cut from the centre of the fillet</li>
            <li>25g butter</li>
            <li>1 thyme sprig</li>
            <li>½ tsp cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>1 large or 2 small shallots, peeled and finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 tbsp brandy</li>
            <li>2 tsp Dijion mustard</li>
            <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>200ml strong beef stock</li>
            <li>3 tbsp crème fraîche</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chopped tarragon (optional)</li>
        </ui>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Generously season the steaks all over with salt, then press them down slightly with the palm of your hand so they’re roughly the same thickness.<br> Heat the butter in a heavy-based frying pan over a medium-high heat until foaming, then add the thyme so it crackles and sizzles. Add the steaks<br> and use tongs to turn them every 1 min over the course of 6 mins (for very rare), 8 mins (rare) or 10 mins (medium). This helps build an even<br>crust on both sides. Remove the steaks to a warm plate and leave to rest while you make the sauce.</li>
            <li>Scatter the pepper over the butter and thyme already in the pan. Toast for 1 min, then stir in the shallots and cook for another minute until they<br>start to soften. Turn the heat up to high and tilt the pan so the side is against the flame (if using a gas hob). Carefully splash in the brandy.<br>Flambé the shallots until the flames have died down.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the mustard and Worcestershire sauce. Bubble for a minute, then pour in the stock. Bring to the boil and cook<br>for 2 mins until reduced by half. Stir in the crème fraîche and simmer until rich and creamy. Taste and add more salt if needed. Scoop out the thyme<br>sprig, then return the steaks and any juices to the pan, spooning the sauce over the steaks. Sprinkle over the tarragon, if using. Bring the<br>steaks to the table in the pan and serve drizzled with more sauce.</li>
